I'm Oney Anukam, CC's Communications and Campaigns Manager. Our Open Minds podcast is a series of conversations with people working on the issues we're involved with and the subjects we're excited about. Each episode we sit down with amazing guests who are working to make the internet and our global culture more open and collaborative. On this episode we're doing something different. We'll be playing back the recording of Creative Commons Hybrid Roundtable on the EU Data Act which took place in Brussels on the 14th of June 2022. CC CEO Catherine Styler kicks things off and then Brigitte Vesnair, CC's Director of Open Culture and Policy, moderates an amazing conversation between our distinguished panel on how this new piece of legislation could unlock the potential for better sharing of knowledge and culture in the digital space both across the EU and around the world. That's enough from me, let's hear from the panel. So lovely to see everybody and welcome to those who are joining virtually and welcome to everybody who's here. It's absolutely delightful to have a meeting together so it's just wonderful. So it's great to be back in Brussels and I'm delighted to have been able to round off my meeting program by convening such a diverse and expert audience to discuss this important subject. As you know Creative Commons is just one of several not-for-profit organisations. Its mission and objective is to defend the public interest when it comes to dissemination of and access to culture, education, research and knowledge more broadly. And data is front and centre of that, hence our interest in this subject. So the EU is at the forefront of developing its own rules with the hope that will become a template for future global standards. And much of what the EU is doing in the digital space is of direct relevance to creative commons. And given the central role of data in the digital society that we exist within, it felt natural to be to be the one to bring together various policy and civil society stakeholders this morning to have just this discussion to help us inform the debate so as an open movement it's so natural for us to do this round table uh in a hybrid way and so alongside welcoming those in the room as i said i'd like to welcome all the participants who are here um this morning i should also say and gdpr obliged me to say this that we'll be recording the event and posting it online in order that those who are unable to join us this morning can benefit from the exchange and the rich, thought-provoking exchange that we will have and that can be shared. So thanks again to all of you for your support, and I look forward to staying in touch and continuing this constructive dialogue as the EU's data act evolves. So I'd like now to hand over to Brigitte who will be our compare, who will be moderating and again thanks to you all over here Brigitte. Thank you, thank you very much Catherine for this warm welcome to everyone and nice introduction. Thank you for setting the scene. My name is Brigitte Dvizna. I am Director of Policy and Open Culture at Creative Commons and I'm thrilled to be moderating this roundtable. It's a hybrid event so we'll have the pleasure of hearing from speakers who are here with us in Brussels but also joining us online and I'll be introducing them in a few moments. joining us online and I'll be introducing them in a few moments. Over the next hour, we'll be able to hear from these experts on this new piece of legislation that is really bound to reshape the rules really around governing the value creation around data. And I really can't wait to hear about what our invited experts have to say about what this law is aiming to achieve and also how it might really unlock potential for better sharing of knowledge and culture in the digital space across the EU, but also globally. We'll make sure to save a few minutes for a Q&A. Our experts will be available to answer your questions here in the room and also virtually we'll be able to take a few questions. But without further ado, I'd like to introduce all of our speakers and then I'll hand over to our first one in a few moments. So allow me first to introduce Ms. Anna Ludin. Anna, welcome. Anna is Policy Officer at the EU Commission, DG Connect, and the unit responsible for data policy and innovation. Her focus is on horizontal policy and legal questions around data access and use. Anna will briefly present up to us the general aim of the Data Act proposal and its different pillars. Following Anna, we'll have Ms. Crystal Scheldamose, who's a member of the European Parliament. Crystal is head of the delegation of the Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament. Welcome, Crystal, joining us virtually. She is the S&D Group's coordinator in the committee on the internal market and consumer protection and substitute member of the committee on the environment, public health and food safety. She's also head of the Parliament's delegation to Japan. She's working on among other things, digital development. She's a disruptor for the DSA, consumer protection, and the green transition. Welcome. We look forward to your comments further on. Following that, we'll have Amandine Lepapre, who's also joining us over from London, I believe. Amandine is CEO and co-founder for Element, an open source, secure and interoperable, sorry, interoperable collaboration tool built on the matrix, a unique initiative aiming to democratize secure online communication and solve the problem of fragmentation in current chat, voice over IP and IoT technologies. And our last speaker will be Paul Keller sitting next to me. Paul is director of policy at Open Future, an organization that believes in open Internet as possible, one that maximizes societal benefits of shared data, knowledge, and culture. Paul has almost 20 years of experience as a media activist, open policy advocate, and systems architect, and we're very much looking to hearing about your perspectives to close us off. So I would like now to pass the floor to Anna to give us a little view of the data. Over to you, Anna. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, first of all, for the invitation. I'm delighted to be here today and also a great opportunity to hear about your thoughts on the data. I'm very interested in the discussion. So first of all, let me maybe briefly introduce what the Data Act is actually about. I'm sure many of you are already experts in the field, but I think it's always helpful to have a common ground for the discussion. So the Data Act is, as you all know, a second horizontal legislative initiative out of the data strategy from the European Commission from February 2020. So what have we done in the last two years or over two years already? So first of all, we had the proposal on the Data Governance Act that is already adopted by now and published. Beginning of last month, we published the Data Governance Act. And in February this year, we published the second horizontal proposal on data, which is the Data Act. And while this first horizontal proposal, the DTA, was more focusing on incentives for voluntary data sharing, the Data Act now has this aim of how to ensure the fair allocation of value creation of the data economy. So how do we, that's a, I think, great aim and everyone can more or less say yes, we want this. And how do we actually do that? And you will see when you have a closer look at the Data Act proposal, that of course we have different chapters and different chapters do different things. So that's a first thing to understand when looking at the data act, really the different chapters have different scopes and are different tools basically for this great aim to ensure the fair allocation of value. So maybe I start with the first part, which is I think also the one that is most discussed, I would say, in the public debate, which is the access to IoT data. So in chapter two and three of the proposal, you find the rules on accessing data in an IoT context. What does it mean? So basically, they're all aware that IoT objects, no matter if it's an industry machine that is connected or a car or a washing machine or a clean robot, everything is, of course, generating data all the time. in areas, scenarios where the manufacturer is more and more in an exclusive situation to be able to use that data and offer also exclusive services on the basis of this data that is generated with the use of the data. And so we deemed it would be essential to put the user actually in control of such data by enabling the user, no matter if it's a business or consumer, to access the data that is generated with the use of the IoT. So it's kind of a broad scope here because we're talking about any kind of product that is connected and is generating data. And we're also talking as much about the B2B as the B2C context. And here we're not only enabling the user himself, but also we enable the user to port the data basically to a third party because the aim is here to have more innovation in the aftermarkets of such products. So you are probably aware and familiar with use cases like the cars, of course, from an example where there has been already a very intensive debate about we need more services in the aftermarket, more services in the aftermarket, more competition in the aftermarket, more innovation. And for that, we think all around IoT objects, basically, we have this kind of triangle scenario whereby not only the user should be in control of its data, but also because the user in many cases might not be the one to make most of the use of the data, he should be able to actually pause the data and that's a principle that is already in the GDPR, but it hasn't been very effective in practice so we wanted to extend it also to non-personal data and make it even more effective by a design proposal. All the objects need to be designed in a way so that you have effective access to such data. So all of that is in chapter two and three. But there are other parts of the data. I'm just going to briefly mention it. Take your time. So another part is, for example, contractual fairness. In chapter four of the proposal, look at putting the FFE back at the negotiating table when it comes to data sharing provisions and contracts. So it means that there are certain clauses that will be forbidden where an SME is the weaker party in a contract and it's unilaterally imposed on the SME. So it's kind of a narrow scope here. But the aim is to make the contracts about data sharing more fair, and here also to take into account when there are co-generating scenarios and basically not cut out one part of the agreement from creating value out of the data. So that is the general idea with Chapter 4. And then another part of the Data Act is then the B2G data sharing. And I think some of the panel will be also interested in this part. B2G data sharing stands for business with government data sharing, that's chapter five. And here we look at exceptional variations of data of the public sector. So basically this is really a horizontal framework to enable the public sector. It can be an EU institution, it can be a public sector body from a member state that is in need in an exceptional situation for data from private sector and can access such data on the basis of this framework. There are clear principles set out to make sure that there will not be any abusive requests of data and it's really an exceptional framework. I want to stress this because, I mean, there has been a lot of discussion before the proposal, how far should that go? And he took into account also the feedback in the consultation. And I think there was a concern that it would be too broad. And so we narrowed it down to make it as precise as possible to exceptional need situations. That could be a pandemic, it could be a flood, it could be anything that is really exceptional and where the public sector has basically no other means to get access to such data. I think it's an interesting starting point for this topic. Then last but not least, there are provisions of course on cloud switching. So the proposal aims also at making the cloud markets more competitive, more fluid by obliging basically the switchability between cloud service providers. And then you will find provision also on interoperability. It's a very hard word to pronounce. Basically there is a mandate foreseen for the Commission to step in in situations where sectoral industry-led initiatives are deemed not to be sufficient. What does it mean? We will see in detail, but first we start with this mandate to have something also on this important topic of better interoperability that is essential for the data economy. Thank you. Thank you very much, Anna. I think it was a great introduction, getting us all on the same page, very clear and very instructive. I'll pass now over to Crystal, who will give us your views on the Data Act, but also perhaps more on the broader digital agenda in the EU. Over to you, Christel. Thank you very much. And first and foremost, thank you for the invitation. And even though I can't really see you, Catherine, it's good to see that I'm happy to be here with you again. And it was great meeting you in San Francisco for a couple of weeks ago. Anyway, well, you know, I have to say that coming from a Nordic country where we have a lot of data and we are rather digitalized, I am really, really happy to see all the many initiatives from the EU Commission in the area of the digital transition. I believe that it is as important as the green transition. as the green transition. So I'm really happy to see the whole framework being set up and that we're moving very fast in order to make sure that we are delivering on the different legislative proposals. And so that's a general remark. I find it really, really important. There is, in my opinion, no doubt that the economy in the future will be data-driven, and therefore we need to find our ways in this, and we also need to be a bit more competitive in EU than we have been so far. And it's not about us against the Americans, for instance, but I do believe that it would be good if EU could really set the global standards as we did on the GDPR, as we are doing on the DSA, I guess. So I hope that also in many other areas we can be a part of this and deliver on this. For me, I think that there are many different aspects that need to be taken into account and that needs to be balanced in a good manner. First and foremost, I think that we need a better competition and that's why it's good that we are getting a lot of different proposals adopted so that we have a level playing field that we have rules in place so that we know how to tackle it in terms of for instance pandemics but also in general when we are working businesses to governments or business to business or how it works. So I think that it makes sense that we have many good proposals being adopted. So better competition is one. I also think that we need in general to be aware that we also need a better protection of users. And users can, of course, be individuals. We're not talking about personal data here. Privacy is the basic. We need that to function. But also protection of business users. So definitely, I think it's good that we also have, for instance, the DSA. So if you're a business user using platforms, you will be better protected with many of the new rules we are adopting in the DSA. on how to deliver on common goods. How can we better use our data for common goods? And in Denmark, for instance, we have a lot of weather data. They were publicly financed, but we have opened up for these data in order to create better competition, give other businesses a chance to use these data to help citizens, to help businesses, etc. I think that let's share, let's use these data for the common good, for the purpose of the common good, more than we have done so far. And in order to do that, we need to make sure that everybody has access, that everybody can use these data. And that's why we also need to look into the quality of data. Data needs to be standardized. We need to make sure that they have a certain quality. And I think that that's a part of it. One of these things is amongst, as we heard, interoperability. That is so important that we find our ways through this. We are not completely there yet, but I think that the push we have on the EU Commission to come up with good proposals, the DMA for instance has already some obligations on interoperability. I hope that we will go even further, even though we're not discussing today the health data space that the EU Commission has delivered on as well, the health data space that the EU Commission has delivered on as well. But that's also a part of the whole transition. We need to make sure that we can make sure the data are interoperable, even though it might be difficult, even though in the beginning it might be costly for some member states and even businesses to have to use certain standards and not their own. So in many ways, I think that's important. And of course, privacy. So in general, better competition, better protection of the users, also citizens, but users in general, better use for common goods and interoperability, high quality of data, standards of data. That is very important because if we deliver on all these things, we will be able to have a better frame for a digital driven economy in the future. So how about the Data Act? Well, I think in many ways it's good. We need maybe to find an even better balance that proposal has, but we need to facilitate access. We need to provide for the use of by public sector bodies. We need to also, as you mentioned, we need to facilitate switching between cloud and edge services, for instance. So in many ways, I think that we will have to define these things. We have to find the right way and the right balances. But in general, and then, of course, we need to put into place safeguards. But that's always what we do in EU. We always need to have safeguards in place for public interest, for individual interest, for users. And I think that we're trying to deliver that. So I am a very big fan of the digital transition, as long as we're doing it on a basis that is protecting individuals, doing it on a basis that is protecting individuals, protecting privacy, protecting fairness, and making sure that this data-driven economy is not just for businesses, but also for the common good. So that's where I stand on this. And I'm looking forward to have a discussion with you the rest of this hour. Thank you very much. Thank you so much, Christel. That was really insightful. Also, to take a step back and look into the wider context of the digital transition. I'd like now to give the floor to Amandine, if you can join our conversation and give perhaps your take on the CEDAR Act proposal and all things digital as you see them. Over to you. and did all things digital as you see them. Over to you. Thank you. Thank you for having me today. So yeah, just to give a bit of context on how I ended up here, basically. So you know how today, basically everyone needs to install the same chat app to talk to your friends. So every time you have to install a new one. So we build secure communication apps which actually can interpret with one another. And we do it thanks to an open standard, which is called Matrix, that we created. And basically, we provide the ability to anyone to run their own fully-encrypted equivalent of Slack or WhatsApp using whatever interface they want to use and yet interpret with anyone else in the matrix network. So the idea is very much to reproduce what email is doing, where you can send an email from your company address to anyone who is using email and whatever the end user is actually using to read the message. And that's what we want to do for chat and voice over IP. So we built matrix to break the fragmentation of this communication industry and the monopoly of a few big players. And really, the idea is to bring back the control to the users over the conversations and open up this market. Make sure that it's an open ecosystem, that there can be competition so that innovation comes back into the world. Anyone should be able to use the app they want to communicate and choose who they trust with their data. So Matrix today is a 60 million users network. It's across 95,000 deployments and it's used across the entirety of the French government, the German armed forces, the UK MOD, US DOD, but also private companies like Mozilla or Red Hat or Wikimedia. It has also been mandated by the German healthcare regulator for all communications in the healthcare industry in Germany. So as a company, Element, so Matrix is managed by a non-profit foundation, which is taking care of the standard. Element as a company, we're HQ'd in the UK, but we have entities in France, as you can guess from my accent, and Germany, and we operate a lot in Europe because, as Catherine and Crystal said, Europe is really leading the charge in terms of data sovereignty, data privacy, and ownership. So when the DMA came up, the Digital Markets Act came up, it was really a validation for us by the EU that we're not the only ones thinking that the digital market needs to be opened up and the control needs to be brought back to the users. The fragmented markets actually completely stiffen innovation, they create big honeypots of data and they prevent users to have any control whatsoever on what is being done to their conversations, to the data about them, etc. So we're very happy that the EU actually delivered the mandated interoperability there. And for the Data Act, it's very similar. We really like that it's pushing for more data sovereignty by enabling the users to access their data anywhere and move it from one place to another, make it accessible by a different service wherever it's available. And as an SME, we're also really strongly supporting this idea of bringing more negotiation power for small entities in the data sharing contracts, because it's so easy. You're really powerless facing an Amazon or whatever when you're trying to bring this contract. So basically, the data support, the interoperability that we've been advocating for for eight years now, and it's really a good opportunity to start agreeing on open standards. So companies don't have to implement the APIs of every other single company. Because yes, it's maybe a bit of an effort to implement a new open standard, but yet it's cheaper than actually have to do 10, 20 implementations to be able to interpret with the hundreds of other companies out there. So we, so that's obviously, that's also why we created matrix as an open standard we believe it's the way to go bring everyone on the same playing field and make it easy for data to hear from Christelle about the fact that privacy is a basic and we really need to be careful in how we implement things because we really need to make sure that the data is protected anywhere when it's shared. We also have looking at the business to government setup we also need to ensure that it doesn't give governments who are not in the EU the opportunity to infringe the local laws and the rights for the users like breaking encryption, for example, breaking encryption is not going to bring any good to anyone. So yes, as you as you can see, basically, we've, we're really supporting all these initiatives that the EU is, is doing in in the area of opening up markets, making digital markets better for the common good, small companies, small businesses, and the end users in the end. Thank you, Amandine. And I can hear the concept of the common good coming up over and over. It seems to be a red thread flowing through the conversation. Paul, I'll hand over to you if you can give us a few insights about all the policy work that you've been doing on the DATA Act. Over to you. Yes, thank you. So welcome and I largely agree with most of the things that have been said by the previous speakers that focus on mechanisms to improve the common good and not only economic progress is important and it's an important opportunity that we're having for the DATA Act and in our work we try to focus on that. But make three remarks on the data. The first one is very briefly on that first chapter, which Anna introduced the IoT data sharing. I think we from Open Future, but also from I think the wider community around Creative Commons, around Comunia, are very happy that the commission has, in the end, chosen an approach that is based on providing access rights to this data, so not commodifying the data that's involved, not creating new exclusive rights. People will remember the approach taken 25 years ago on the database directive, where the idea was you need to basically create new, switch switch generis rights in data to make um them worth uh something in the economy and like we've advanced in our thinking and it's very welcome that this approach has not been extended i'll come back to that at the very end of my um intervention so so so i think this is good path there's obviously like it's a complex chapter also with the fairness obligations. There is a lot of stuff where we need to look into the details, but generally this seems like very sensible approach here. And we generally think it's worth pushing this forward. There's probably some alignment question with other things like the Data Governance Act, for example. The second part I want to touch on briefly is I think people hinted at this, is our main focus has been on this idea of business to government data sharing. Sharing of privately held information, privately held data, held by businesses for government entities. It's EU level governments, but also national government entities in order to fulfill their tasks. And the commission has chosen this approach, which basically goes in response to emergencies and in response to what's termed exceptional situations. Most of these approaches are, I think, valid, but most of them are also sort of ad hoc data sharing. This is not structural data sharing. So you will also see that data that is shared in this, in the end, needs to be deleted, right? Like, so this is the idea that maybe situations, the emergencies, which you outlined, which is floods or pandemics or the like, where it's very temporary to have access to certain data, or this other situation of exceptional need, which is basically defined as where government entities have no other way of executing or carrying out their legally mandated functions other than having access to this data, but also that is envisaged as temporary. And we know from, like, I mean, this idea of public interest data sharing from business to government is a discussion that is going on for 10 years or so in the, at least in the European Union, there've been high level expert groups, there's been a lot of research being done in this, and there's been much stronger proposals on this, right? Like the idea that in certain situations, in certain public, the public interest, the common good mandates that businesses share data with the government and maybe also with the public, think about researchers, think about academics, think about to approve, like to achieve some societal level benefit, right? And that is seen by people who have imagined this as a much more structural thing where the data is not necessarily deleted afterwards, where it's made available, for example, to academics, et cetera. And we think this is very much like this should be what should have been in the data. We know from like all the underlying documentation, from the impact assessments, from studies that have been done that situations like this have been considered but have been ultimately rejected for a less invasive policy option and the main rationale there seems to be that all of this has been mainly analyzed in terms of economic impact right like we're we're doing something which is we're trying to achieve something which is not primarily economic in nature we try to to unlock certain amounts certain types of data for the public good and we're we're basically bringing a economic cost benefit analyst to bear on these situations come to the conclusion this is going to have lots of costs for the business actors therefore we can't do this. So this is by employing the measurement tool, we're basically saying like the outcome is almost guaranteed that we commission in this case arrives at the least invasive policy option. And this is a missed opportunity. We think this can still be fixed. We have recently published a policy brief that presents a model which says, yes, there's one part of the commission's proposal that is spot on for like these exceptional situations for the emergency situations where data sharing can indeed be something that is temporary and that is not hot, but there should also be a structural thing where data sharing, where shared data actually feeds into what we call a public data comment so you introduce some kind of like organization which gets this data which makes sure that we're talking about non-personal data or where it's it's about personal data about probably anonymized personal data and it makes this data available not necessarily as open data as we know this from i guess like all our open data work in the past or the open data directive, but at least makes this available to requests from academics, from maybe also small and medium enterprises who are doing research for developing new products and keeps this data available for the public interest. We have this published as a brief with like a nice diagram, and I encourage all of you to read this or ask some questions afterwards in the question and answer section but we really think this is like this is the one part where the proposal can substantially be improved where it falls a little bit short otherwise we're quite happy to see the proposal here one last point in the in the run-up to the proposal the commission promised a review of the sui generis database right that was introduced by the 2000 not 2019 96 database directive and in the the data act there is one chapter which consists of one article 35 which says basically the sui generis database right does not apply to situation to to machine generate data by these article 35 which says basically the sewage and a very helpful in these situations and therefore we declare it not applicable in this particular context which is something which goes like a red threat to all recent EU legislation in the field of data the open data directive the data governance act like almost all of them say like by the way this is a generous database right it's a nuisance and we don't want it to play into this particular field and and we really think like commission made a promise to review this directive and maybe it's still coming and definitely should still come. And we really need to consider if this approach that was chosen like almost 25 years ago to grant exclusive rights in databases in order to facilitate or encourage the production of data is still relevant in a day and age where essentially everything we do produces tons of data just by doing these things. So we think like this right maybe has served its purpose and we would like to see like a proper review of this. Thank you very much and I'm looking forward to your questions and comments and back to you. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, I think you really launched the discussion phase of this roundtable. I wonder if I could open the floor to any questions from people here in the room. Yes, we have about 15, 20 minutes for questions. So I'm sure everyone will have an opportunity to to say a few words also from all of our panelists. If there's something that you would like to add or comment on, feel free to do so. Could you please introduce yourself, say a few words, and then your questions. My name is Hugo Portoban. I work in the Secretariat of Data Act. My question is about, is all data equal? Because one of the things, especially for chapter two, when we're talking about the Internet of Things, when I do talk with my colleagues, the political part of the parliament, we're discussing like includes all data that is generated. And here we see maybe sometimes I need to have a nuance, at least at the beginning of the conversation, maybe we converge at the end to say all data is to be shared and have rights for the user to share with the habit and to share if they want. But without having this distinction at the beginning, it's very difficult to us to just admit that all data is valid. Yes, is this a question to a particular panelist? No, I think, I mean, what you say is basically that the scope is super broad in chapter two and three, right? And also... Yeah, I don't know if it's broad. I mean, it's broad to us. It seems difficult to understand that all data is part of the scope and it's difficult to discuss if just data is right to share it or not, we don't start to have a bit of categorization of data. I think the idea, just to explain where we're coming from, basically the idea was here to not limit the scope from the beginning and then end up with basically a scope, how we know it may be from sectoral instruments that could be too limited to then in the end enable certain innovations that might not be evident at first look. So that is where we're coming from. And that's where we're saying all the data that is actually generated from the object. Then now of course in the interaction stakeholders we hear many concerns that in certain scenarios it might be a lot and it might maybe the negotiations and the discussions will have to look at how can we be more precise but I think as a general approach it's important to understand that starting to look at an object, you know there are also transparency rules in terms of the manufacturer, the data holder, at the beginning also to make it now transparent what kind of data is supposed to be generated with the use of the object and I think that's also a transparency starting point for all the users and all the marketplace basically to better understand what kind of data comes out of this object and then what could be possibly an interesting use of such data. As long as we are a little bit in the dark maybe about what kind of interesting data could be also relevant for innovation, we thought it would be better to not too much restrict it from the beginning. That's where we come from. Thank you. We thought it would be better to not too much restricted from the beginning. That's where we come from. Thank you. Paul, would you like to also? Well, so generally, like my intervention was a little bit more focused on the part about business data, business government data sharing. And I think in that area, obviously, like, so data is, right? Like everything is data. And it's very hard. Like we've always had these ideas to draw lines between personal, non-personal data or certain other categories, which nobody has really convincingly done unless you get there, almost everything to be personal data, because like with enough effort, obviously you can almost always bring something back to insights about persons. There may be exceptions, but in the end, a machine, something operated by a human at some point, you probably can figure out something about that human if you look closely enough. So what we think, and what's maybe not enough in this is this approach like really the data act which is a horizontal framework and we see this approach and the first one is this regulation on the European health data space like a technical approach. The health data is the prime example sector which has very specific requirements and very specific concerns about the type of data being used. And there's obviously this approach which should be taken that the more specific regulatory framework should prevail over whatever is in the horizontal framework. And so we need to take great care that we're having like various ways specifically sensitive data or data that where for example personal data is extremely prevalent that we maybe have specific rules that apply to distance that should take place right like so this this does not necessarily mean that you need to have a definition in the data act say like hey there's certain stuff which over time by by passing uh as sectoral regulation gets taken out and gets dealt with the specificity it deserves. And I think Crystal deserves. Yes, go ahead Crystal. Thank you very much. I mean in many ways I understand also the question about, you know, what do we do with the data? what do we do with the data, are they personal or private, or is it a company data? I mean, in many ways, we need in the EU legislation to be able to tackle every part of this. I was working with a free flow of non-personal data act we made in the last mandate, and we had lengthy debates about personal data and what happened if you had a data set with both personal and non-personal data. And the risk of being able to make non-personal data suddenly personal. And I think that we landed it in a good way because we think it is key to protect citizens' personal data. to protect citizens' personal data. But then when we're talking about Internet of Things or, you know, for instance, car data, for me, we need really to have this basic understanding and basic legislation in place where there are no doubt that if it is personal, it should not be shared. But then what if you allow it to be shared or today if you buy a car a complete new car the car companies they make their cars in a way that they automatically send all the data to the car manufacturer and in many ways i understand them it makes good sense for them to know how fast we're driving i mean if you if you ask a car driver, how do you drive? We all drive in a good manner. But if you take a look at the data, they might show that we under certain conditions are not driving in a good manner anyway. But it's good to have these data in place when you make a new car. However, for us, for me, it's a question of how do we use these data. I think that we need to understand that the individual who generate data also need to give consent, but that a consent in itself should also be restricted if it's truly personal. So I think that just to say that I think that there's so many issues around this that we need to be careful about. We will generate more and more and more data, personal and non-personal. They are good for companies. They're good for governments in order to make sure that we can deliver services for citizens and for societies and maybe even tackle the climate challenges. But we also need to understand that there is another side of it and that we need to also be able to have control over the data we ourselves and as individuals are generating. However, I believe that for many citizens, it might be more easy to share data if they understand how they share them, what they will be used for, what kind of purposes. For instance, if it's for the common good, I personally would be more happy to share my data rather than if it was for commercial purposes. People might see differently than I do. But just to let you know that in the European Parliament, we're discussing all these things and we need to find the right balance. But again, privacy is key, is the basis of everything we're doing here. privacy is key, is the basis of everything we're doing here. So every time you have a data that might end up being personal data or is non-personal, but can be combined, end up being a personal data, then we need to be very, very, very cautious. But it should not stop us from making sure that we are looking into how we can have this well-driven data economy in the future. Thank you. Maybe Anandine wants to say a few words on this. So, yeah, I think I agree with everything which has been said. Basically, the key is definitely to make sure that whatever is shared cannot be linked to anyone in particular. There is so much to be done with the data to improve a lot of things, quality of life, the climate, make the world more efficient. efficient. But it's really super important that the privacy is preserved, and that we need to make sure that if there is a tiny risk of the data being linked to someone or becoming a personal data, it's not it's not going to be shared as is. Thank you, you wanted to bounce back on what's been said, honestly, bounce back, there's one interesting thing in like which has gotten a lot of attention, but I guess little bits in the data, which are interesting in the sense that they qualify certain types of actors who cannot do certain things or certain things that cannot be done. And like, that's an interesting approach to kind of like the framework, it's basically like that side and it gives entities agencies but it gives agency, but it also puts stop to it. Like one of the more interesting parts, like I think it's sort of, if you take out the data from a service, you can share that with, you have the right to share that third parties, but you cannot share it with like the big tech platforms, the gatekeepers as defined in the DMA. So it's something like you see, it's interesting because like pieces of framework clicking in, in each other, but it's also this idea of, Hey, there is certain structural conditions in the market, which may be dangerous to, or problematic to give people the right just then feed the data to like very dominant players. There's a certain other ideas, for example, which we are more critical of, like the data that's being shared cannot be used by the recipients for developing competing products or services, which sort of undermines the sort of some of the objectives, one might think, but this general approach these little exceptions to the rule or this little intervention saying like, we want to put a specific automatic use of data are very interesting and probably deserve a closer look and see like if they are if they are targeted if they are fit for purpose and maybe they should they can be expanded in some places or refined in others but yeah. I mean it has been mentioned, I think all the new access rights also all the new rules they need safeguards as well and so in terms of these safeguards, where are set limits also? We looked at policy coherence also with the DMA and we thought, okay, we enable actors to use the data, but on the other side of the equation, of course, we hear lots of concerns that what about misuse of the data? What about feeding or making even the biggest figure? So that's not the aim of the proposal. The proposal is really at the core and SME instrument and wants to enable those who are excluded of the valuation of the data economies so far and then for that purpose, we of course also have this provision that indeed the so-called eligible third parties should not be the gatekeepers out of the PMA. However, you will find also in the recitals that shows that market mechanisms will continue to work outside of the Data Act. We believe that the biggest players, they don't need these new access rights to get their hands on the data. So and that was the logic behind this exclusion. And you're also pointing at certain limits to certain users. I think that's Article 6, what can the third party do with the data? And of course, also here, I mean, you will have seen it if you followed the debate that also, of course, privacy, people have lots of concerns of what can happen with the data. And so I think there was a consensus also in terms of policy coherence with other digital files that we wanted to have limits and safeguards for how the data could be used and that it shouldn't be misused. And if there are details that should be looked at closer, I think we're open to it. Yes, thank you so much i think the conversation very rich we have one uh one other question could you please uh say who you are and uh and who are you oh thank you uh my name is jeremy collison i work with microsoft uh just down the street um we're interested in the file across the board but i think i agree with mostly everything that said, especially false intervention on the IP elements that haven't been discussed so much. I completely agree with the Sue Generous right carve out. I had a couple of questions coming back to Anna's presentation. One, we didn't hear much about Article 27 in Chapter 7. I did want to learn more what compliance is expected to look like in that context. That's on the International Safeguards for Data Processing Services. We have a lot of questions. I think there's a lot of ambiguity in that language. And to say it, we see the same language in the DGA. You see the same language in the health data space. What does that mean exactly? You get very different interpretations from different member states, some of whom say it's full-on localization. And there's only certain models that would be compliant with it, which is, you know, rather bold if you're talking about the inherent openness, the data sharing opportunity. So I wonder if you could say more about that. And then on chapter two, completely agree with the scope of the data questions. I think the question that we have is those ecosystems are so large. And what is our role in that context? In other words, are we a data holder for one of our manufacturing customers' data? Could a data recipient or the end user come to any provider in that ecosystem on whose equipment there may rest some data? Because that would go against the contractual commitments we make in that space as well. So if we have an automotive customer and we're engaged in that software development with sometimes hundreds of other players, would that be hundreds of data holders for that end user to go to? Or is it really only the automotive manufacturer? Because again, there are those contractual commitments. And then a final question on chapter six and the chapter eight discussions around switching. I think everyone agrees on the objective there. But is it desirable or is it foreseen to have really a standardized set of cloud services in Europe? Because we don't see that across customer segments as being something desirable. You want to have choice. And is it foreseen to really have an overall standardized way of looking at the cloud? And then second question is really the technical feasibility of some of these things. If you think of concepts like functional equivalence, if Chris wants to leave my cloud to another cloud, I can do everything in my power to make that easy for him. But a lot of it depends on Chris. A lot of it depends on the recipient, and there's no way that I can guarantee Chris will have the same experience on that new cloud because I don't know anything about that new cloud. And so is it possible to kind of understand the language in a way that it reflects those different responsibilities? Thank you. I mentioned it and the wording of the statement in the DG8. Now here it looks at different actors and it looks basically at a safeguard or it is considered a safeguard for the users of data processing services from governmental access from third countries when this access request is considered illegal. So that is the logic and nothing else should not be understood as a data localization measure. I think we have been clear in several interactions on this but yeah happy to hear your feedback on this and on the scope of data, your question was a the data holder. Well, the idea was to leave flexibility for situations where the manufacturer might not be the data holder. That's why there is a term of data holder. So the data holder should be able to grant the actual access to the data, but the cloud services behind or the services that a manufacturer or a service provider of the IoT object is using should not be, in my understanding, conceived as the data hall. I think that should be also clear from the recital language, but I'm happy to have another look at this. On switching, so my understanding is that the chaplains leave room for at least a more differentiated understanding of, of course, the diversity in the cloud market and in cloud services. And I think that should also be reflected in the new rules. And but of course, as you point out, the disability is a concern and technical disability should always be observed. Yeah, we need to continue our discussions. Are there any, oh, Amal, didn't you want to also take on this question? Go ahead. Yeah, I wanted to react mostly on the last one in terms of the ability to switch and standardization, etc. It's basically what I wanted to say is that it's not because you have a standard which allows you to move from one place to another, that it means everyone needs to handle the data in a standardized manner. It's all a matter of building bridges, making sure things can be translated from one place to another. We've been doing that because Matrix is actually building bridges between different applications. because matrix is actually building bridges between different applications. And it's an exercise that is worth doing in terms of making sure that the user actually has this right and this control over their data. It means everyone needs to participate in the effort and open display their APIs. And either everyone agrees on the common API to be used or at least if the APIs are open people can build bridges or migration services which allows you to move from one place to another so if Microsoft may not be building migration services from a tiny company then the tiny company may do it the other way around. It's not always simple. If we want to define a standard, it may be take a bit of time and it's not necessarily going to be simple, but it's definitely doable. Thank you. Did you want to react, Christelle, as well to this question? No? All right. I think we have time for one last question, if anyone would like to take the floor. Yes, go ahead, please. One second, we'll bring the microphone. Good morning, my name is Ilaira Zanadjibint and I work for the S&D Secretariat, specifically in the Committee for Legal Affairs, which, as you know, will to some extent be involved in the negotiations of the Data Act. And we specifically in the S&D have the rapporteurship in that committee. As you know as well, one of the competencies that people most likely get in this context relates to anything about IP. There are many questions that I could ask, but perhaps one that has been floating around also in internal discussions is why the Commission chose not to go into so much detail when it comes to how trade secret protection would have to be carried out in practice, especially as this is something that might deter some businesses from going forward with data sharing, especially in the context of B2G sharing, which is one that we also, from a political perspective, would very much like to encourage. But as I said, there are many follow-up questions, but for now I would stick to this one. Thank you. If I understood correctly, you're pointing at our approach to trade secrets and the new access. So what we conceived in chapter two and three, and I think you find something similar in chapter five of B2G, is basically that the data access cannot be in general refused, rejected because of trade secrets. Basically to avoid that trade secrets are a general, can be a general excuse for granted data access. We think that there should contractual agreements ensuring the confidentiality basically, NDAs or other measures that could be taken. Why are results more precise? I think that was also the question. I think it might also depend on the context. What do you actually need? And I think we're also open to give more precision, but I think as a general concept that we address this issue is important because we can learn from different fields around data access that of course issues such as data protection trade secrets and other reasons can be also a very very broad exemption and if it's too broad then in the end it will lead to no data access scenarios and that was our intention to avoid that it's generally thank you very much unfortunately this brings us to the end of this roundtable it's been a really rich debate very insightful from all of our panelists I'd like to give a round of applause to everyone I think that's virtually as well and yeah it's been a very interesting conversation I will hand over to Catherine to give us a few concluding remarks oh thanks I'll be very brief but thank you so much and I think this has been a really great discussion and I want to thank Rajit for your smooth moderation because it's been wonderful to have Crystal and Amandine here with us so this is just fantastic and there's a lot to reflect on a lot of food for thought and I know there's several action points certainly I've noted down but I think my main takeaway is just I mean this is complex but yet if we get legislation right in this space the opportunities are so important and as the EU regime evolves I think I think it's critical that the international context and the public interest, I think that's come across in so many of the points that have been made, is so important and not forlout. I also think the Data Act is an opportunity for the EU to be a global leader in creating a human-centric system, putting citizens in control of how they use and share their data. And then interoperability seems to be again another huge opportunity for the EU to set global standards whilst at the same time exporting and values around the common good and public interest. So I know we've had a little thank you from Brigitte to our speakers but I want to say little thank you from Brigitte to our speakers but I want to say thank you to Anna, thank you to Crystal, thank you to Amandine and thank you to Paul for all your contributions. I want to thank the CCT, there are people here in the room but there are people not here in the room today who have been really central for bringing this together and setting this up. So I hope this is the first of many policy debates that Creative Commons can convene, bringing together policymakers, civil society and the corporate world. And we'll only succeed in building a better internet and having better sharing if we work together to ensure open data is a reality for all and not just a few. So thanks to all of you.
