The podcast aims to provide users with a well-informed perspective on interesting aspects of the interviews from a particular country. For each episode, one of the project staff interviews an expert on that country site. Welcome to this episode of Contextualizing Feminist Voices. My name is Macy Afsari. In this episode, I'm talking with my American University of Central Asia colleague, Professor Chris Fort, who will provide a perspective on the interviews from Russia. Because we have limited time, we will get right to the point. Chris, what are one or two themes that come up in the interviews that users should pay close attention to? Because those themes are particularly important in Russia's women's movement, scholarship, or activism. Number one, kind of the interesting ways in which the collapse of the Soviet Union engenders both possibilities and new conflicts in Russian society. So the very first interview I worked on was that of Yelena Kochkina, and she talks quite a bit about how precisely as the Soviet Union is falling apart, she's getting involved with these academic circles and learning about the social construct of gender. And a number of women have this same experience. That's because Soviet Marxism was so focused on the worker and that worker was typically male, although that was left unsaid. Women were workers too, but there was no gendered aspect that went into any of the scholarship on it. So this was something incredibly new for them. But at the same time, and Coach cannot focus quite a bit on this, as well as Lyubov Stilyova, they both talk about neoliberalism in the 90s as eroding a lot of the women's rights and privileges that they had won under the Soviet Union. So one thing that Kochkina talks about in particular is that under the Soviet Union, all the benefits, the child care rate, were rolled into employers, and they were all state employers. But once everything was privatized, that's all gone. And so this was lost pretty much instantly once the reforms started under Yeltsin. Then you get to later battles under Putin. His presidency begins in the 2000s and traditionalism starts to ratchet up towards the late 2000s and gets even more so. And that's something that women activists are continually fighting. Like, there hasn't been a ban on abortion, but there's constantly a threat of that. Recently, domestic abuse was pretty much legalized. Basically, the police don't accept reports of it anymore. They were complaining that's all he said, she said, and they didn't want to deal with it. Yeah, so that's one observation that I've seen. The ways in which we can talk about new things now, but there's also new fronts to fight on. And then a second thing I think listeners and viewers should look out for is the differences between women's movements elsewhere and in Russia, and particularly those in the West. So that's a question that's always asked towards the end of our interviews. And I believe it was Mariana Muravyova who has a very interesting example of this. So once the Soviet Union first collapsed, a number of women's activists from the West came over and they wanted to run a workshop teaching women how to manage family finances. And Russian women already knew how to do that because they were the ones in marriages that had to do that. A lot of time, the men were drunk and getting rid of all the money, and they were the ones that had to save the family. So this isn't what they needed to learn. And their experience, their history was totally different. And the rights they were looking for were very different from those that Western women were fighting for. women were fighting for. Thank you, Chris. That's very enlightening. We've learned that some topics that would be illuminating about the women's movement in a particular setting do not get covered in interviews for a variety of reasons. Are there any topics that you'd like to point out for users to notice that are actually missing from the interviews? Yes, there are a few. So a really big one is LGBTQ issues. And I can't say for certain why it is that that doesn't come up with more frequency, but I have a couple of hypotheses. One is a 2013 law, commonly referred to as the gay propaganda law that was passed in Russia. This prohibits anything that gives a positive view of homosexuality or anything associated with it from being broadcast on any kind of media in order to protect children. Of course, that doesn't actually protect children, it ends up harming a number of them. But in any event, yes, none of the interviewees talk about this at any length. And from what I've read, this law, as far as it's enforced, extends well beyond media, such that health professionals self-censor and are very nervous about talking about anything LGBTQ related. So that might be what's going on here. There's two other possibilities as I see it. One is that they were asked questions specifically about the women's movement in the 1990s. And just historically, there's not a lot of solidarity between the LGBTQ movement in Russia and that women's movement as it began in the 1990s. LGBTQ movement in Russia and that women's movement as it began in the 1990s. The other possibilities are just these set of scholars are not as concerned with it or not as involved with it. But that may be precisely because they were chosen for their involvement with this 1990s movement. That's one big absence I noticed. Another one is that most of our interviewees are from what are called Russia's two capitals. So the actual capital is Moscow, but then the other capital, so to speak, it has been a capital in the past, is St. Petersburg. We only have one interviewee outside of those two areas. So we don't get a lot spoken on women's issues in the regions and to what extent they differ from those in the capital. I'm sure there are a number of common issues because, well, fighting neoliberalism and traditionalism is something that cuts across provincial life in the capitals. But there are a number of other concerns as well. I'm not an expert on those. I can't speak to them specifically. What I can speak to is the absence also, not just of regional voices, but of non-Russian voices. The reason for that is that under the Soviet Union, all the work on non-Russian ethnic groups was given to the members of those ethnicities themselves. And if it was in the Republic, say Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, then that was outside of Russia proper. So what would happen is in Moscow and St. Petersburg, they would create the theory. Then local scholars would take that theory and plug their regional variables into it. And so after the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia has very few experts on these non-Russian minorities that used to reside in the Soviet Union and still do. non-Russian minorities that used to reside in the Soviet Union and still do. And as a result, yeah, in our interviews, we don't get a lot of context on their specific issues. Even though many of them are no longer part of Russia, they're still very much involved in the Russian sphere. And just to speak to one issue of that is in Central Asia, a major issue of the women's movement is polygamy. And that's not really something that's talked about in Russia, but it is something that Central Asian's current experience with Russia facilitates. So there are a number of Central Asian migrants that go to Russia, be it Moscow or any other regions, and they're often men and they often get remarried there to a second wife. And sometimes they divorce their first wife in their home country, and sometimes they continue to stay married. And this is a big problem for a number of reasons. Because of maybe our over-focus on the Russian ethnic group, we miss some of the issues associated with feminists and women's rights groups of non-Russian ethnicities. Thank you, Chris.
