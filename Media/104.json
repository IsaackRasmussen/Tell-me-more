    "text": " This podcast series, Contextualizing Feminist Voices, is designed to provide background information for people using the Global Feminism Project website. The podcast aims to provide users with a well-informed perspective on interesting aspects of the interviews from a particular country. For each episode, one of the project staff interviews an expert on that country site. Welcome to this episode of Contextualizing Feminist Voices. My name is Marisol Fila. In this episode, I am talking with my University of Michigan colleague, Professor Swan Caulfield, who will provide a perspective on the interviews from Brazil. Because we have limited time, we will get right to the point. Swan, what are one or two themes that come up in the interviews that users should pay close attention to? Because those themes are particularly important in Brazil's women's movement, scholarship, or activism? There are two things that stand out in particular in Brazil. The first one is race and Black feminism. There have been important generational shifts, which also emerge in the interviews, between the older generation, the historical generation that emerged in the 1970s in opposition to the dictatorship. Usually many feminists were affiliated with political parties, oppositional political parties, such as the Communist Party. And Maria Amelia Telles is an excellent example of that. Her story contrasts with the younger generation of feminists in which Black feminists are especially prominent. And the focus has shifted, although there's still a demand for political representation, and definitely in a new generation that has focused on bringing Black candidates and having more political representation by Black and particularly Black women in the political arena, there's also a very important focus on cultural representation, on the right to control cultural representation by young Black feminists. And so they're talking not only about inclusion, political representation, and equity, but they're also talking about and demanding the right to construct autonomous Black political and cultural spaces that are at the core of Brazilian culture. This emerges in the interviews of women, for example, the women from the Bracui Quilombo. So Quilombos, if you haven't seen the interviews yet, Quilombos are communities of descendants of Afro-Brazilians who escaped enslavement over the 17th through 19th century abolish slavery in 1888. And the archive has interviews with two generations of women from the Quilombo in Bracay in Rio de Janeiro, Marilda Gisosa Francisco, who's one of the founders of that Quilombo, of that space, that community. And two younger women, Luciana Adriano da Silva and Angelica Sosa Piero. And then the other place that this is represented and really emerges really powerfully, the importance of young Black feminists and the kinds of concerns they have with the right to create cultural pluralism, comes out of actually your Marisol, the interviewer Marisol Fila's dissertation research on the Black press. And it's reflected in the interviews that you did, Marisol did, with two young activists in the cultural arena, with two young activists in the cultural arena, both of whom work as influencers in new media, as well as in more traditional arts arenas. And those are the interviews with Ainara Negredos and Gianni Lima. And then the other issue is sexuality and sexual identity. So we have an interview with Laura Castro, who's a young filmmaker, a lesbian mother of three, who represents the remarkably effective and fast, rapid movement for marriage and family equality in the early 2000s. Brazil is still a place where violence against the LGBTQI community is extremely high. And in fact, by some estimates, documented murders of LGBTQ people has been the highest in the world. The issue of sexual identity is particularly important in Brazil for many reasons. Part of the reasons is that trans identity has been a cultural, a really salient, visible cultural phenomenon in Brazil since the early 20th century, arguably even before that. And the recent trans movement is discussed in the interview with Maria Chimalima Santos. But another issue is the trans movement and the movement against the violence, particularly against trans people in Brazil. Thank you so much, Suan. I am sure that this will be very helpful for users to contextualize their interviews. So we now move to the second question. So, Suan, we have learned that some topics that would be illuminating about the women's movement in a particular setting do not get covered in the interviews for a variety of reasons. Are there any topics that you would like to point out for users to notice that are actually missing from the interviews. I'm glad you brought these up because these are two things that we want to, these are two interviews that we're hoping to complete over the coming year. And one is with a representative of the many faceted trans movements in Brazil. The other is sex work. In Brazil, as worldwide, there's a concern with trafficking, international trafficking, and especially trafficking within Brazil of young girls, minors, sexual exploitation. But on the other hand, there's also a very powerful, and there has been historically, since really the 1980s, a powerful sex workers movement who demand equal rights. And they've been quite successful in gaining legal recognition of their work as work and about how to fight trafficking, exploitation, and coercion at the same time that you recognize the rights and offer guarantees to those people who do perform sex work, recognizing it as a reality and affording them the dignity that they're demanding is really important in Brazil, has been a very salient issue. that they're demanding is really important in Brazil, has been a very salient issue. And so we're hoping to also include a representative of sex workers organizations in future interviews. Thank you so much. We really hope to have these interviews in the near future. Those are very important topics. Thank you, Suan, for your time and insights on the interviews from Brazil. Thank you. Thank you. the materials on the website.
