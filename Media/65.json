Our Open Minds podcast is a series of conversations with people working on the issues we're involved with and the subjects we're excited about. Each episode we sit down with amazing guests who are working to make the internet and our global culture more open and collaborative. On this episode, CC's Chief Operating Officer, Ana Tumadottir, sits down for an interesting conversation with Sam Williams, the co-founder and CEO of Arweave, the company that created the Arweave protocol, a permanent archive of human knowledge and experiences on a blockchain. Arweave recently introduced CC licenses as its first licensing standard on the Arweave application. Sam has been immersed in open source since he was a kid and started learning to code when he was nine. So it's no surprise that now he's passionate about building innovative software and solving complex problems in computer networking and has built extensive experience in real world mechanism design and implementation. real-world mechanism design and implementation. When he's not working on our web, Sam actively participates in the decentralized web space as a technical advisor and mentor of blockchain projects. Well, that's enough from me. Let's hand over to Ana and Sam. Welcome, Sam. It is lovely to see you. So at this point, we've given our listeners a little bit of insight into who you are and what you're doing now. But I would like us to go back in time a bit to when you were first introduced to the world of open source and what your background was there. Well, first of all, thank you so much for having me on. This is a really exciting opportunity. Well, I don't remember when I first encountered open source software. It's so long ago that I think it's one of those things that's so early in my childhood memories that, you know, I'm pretty sure I can't recognize the first time. I remember the first time I engaged with a really large piece of open source software, which was installing OpenSUSE, it was called, which is a Linux distribution on my first, you could barely call it a laptop by today's standards, but it was at the time a laptop with this crazy serial cable through a CD drive. And so I had to install this thing off, I think, seven different CDs that I burnt. I was fascinated with Linux for a very long time. I thought it was amazing to have an operating system where all of the components were open and editable. That was the thing that got me really going about it. It's like having a playground as a computer, if you will. And that was super fun. And I must've been nine years old then, something like that. Oh, wow. So you got started early. All right. Well, then it's better that you don't remember when you were introduced to it. Sounds like it was like, I learned to read and open source was there. Exactly. I remember doing Visual Basic 5 was my first programming language, which was horrendous. And then a friend of mine introduced me to Python, really early version of Python. He was building video games with it. You know, hard to call them video games. We're pretty close to video games. Yeah. And I suppose technically that's probably the first open source software I came across. A lovely story. And I am entertained to hear it happen when you were nine years old. You put other nine-year-olds on notice. But okay, so before we dive in too deep on things, can you briefly describe Arweave for your current work and sort of like the problems that you see that it solves and so on? Yeah, 100%. So Arweave is a permanent information storage system. That is what it attempts to build. The simple problem we're trying to solve is sort of twofold. We want to build an open, irrevocable, unforgeable archive of history that is replicated in so many places on earth that it's impossible for any person to alter. It is sort of history beyond the control of any individual or group, collectively owned history, you could call it. And on is sort of history beyond the control of any individual or group, collectively owned history, you could call it. And on this sort of, just a corollary to that, it's not just history, but also knowledge, making knowledge available to all people to access across all time, and making it so that, you know, you could say the long tail of knowledge doesn't degrade. And so in order to build this system, so I was watching blockchains since, well, since Bitcoin, obviously, but like 2010, 2011, that type of period, and I was fascinated. I mean, before that, I was interested in BitTorrent, and this was that you can have an amorphous system for moving information around, basically. And then Bitcoin sort of, would you say, improved on that and said, well, what if we have consensus as part of this system? That was kind of interesting. And then basically what these nodes were building was this ledger, right? A ledger of history. And you could, in fact, embed tiny amounts of information inside them. And you send that transaction, and then your piece of information was replicated in like, you know, well, even in the early days, it was thousands of machines. Now, I guess, tens of thousands of machines around the world. That's pretty cool, I thought. But it wasn't until later in about 2016, I was watching the way the world was tending and I was just finishing my PhD, which I never quite finished because I started this project. But, you know, I was seeing what was happening in the world and I thought, wow, well, it's possible that at least for the first time in my life, we're facing the rise of authoritarianism in the West. And I didn't want to live in a, in a world like that. I felt that freedom and democracy were pretty special things. I profoundly believe that to be true. And so I thought, well, how about that ledger thing, right? Like, so I read a lot about how authoritarian regimes develop, what is required. And I realized that one of the fundamental things is that you have to gain control of the information space at some point. Or well, like nicely, I mean, it's fiction, but it's one of those beautiful sort of meta truths. Like it's fiction, but it is to some extent more true than tales of just one thing. It's a pattern that repeats itself over and over again, expressed as a parable, if you will. And he said that basically by controlling the present, you contain the ability to control access to the past or information about the past. And subsequently you change the way people act in the future. And you know, this happened all over the world where authoritarian regimes developed and it's by no means a silver bullet, it's not going to solve the entire problem. But I figured, huh, that's actually something I'm pretty sure I know how to solve. And so I got a team of people together and we went about solving it. So we made basically what is a blockchain which you can fit arbitrary amounts of data inside so just scaled so you can fit about 160 bytes or whatever it was in bitcoin can now be two to the power 256 bytes so quite a lot larger and then we built this endowment system to pay for it because once you've solved the first problem of you know how do you store data well you get this other problem which is well you're going to store that data forever. How are you going to pay for it? Simple answer for us, we figured was, well, you put in enough storage costs to pay for 200 years worth of storage. And as the cost of storage declines, that 200 years expands out over and over again. And so as long as the storage cost decline rate stays about 0.5%, you end up with more storage purchasing power at the end of any given year than you did at the start. And so we define success as basically leapfrogging this generation of technology, making it so that this data set lives until whatever some bright person 300 years from now creates, which sort of subsumes it, comes along. And so, well, that's what we've been doing. And now we're five years into this journey. We just celebrated the fourth anniversary of the network two weeks ago, and we're coming up on somewhere over 500 million pieces of data stored now. That's impressive. And congratulations on the anniversary. That is an exciting accomplishment. Yeah, it's still good. So it's interesting in terms of sort for instance. And so I'm curious to hear your perspective as to like, why are we specifically is the useful solution for storage of these materials? I understand like this sort of like immutability and for the long haul and so on, but why could they not just be stored elsewhere and be safe? Yeah. Well, I mean, being safe is the critical reason. So when you store a piece of data in Arweave, it's replicated in the basins, 45 places across the world. But in the practical sense, because of the block reward right now, it's actually stored in around a thousand places around the world with no centralized controller. So when we were starting out, we were looking at, you know, how do archives fail? And the answer is essentially the Library of Alexandria problem, right? So either there's fire, flood, or the government comes and destroys the data or another government comes, a, you know, invader essentially. Well, by, you know, blockchains are extremely attractive for solving this problem because they allow you to maintain ledgers of information where there is no leader anywhere in the world. And the system is highly redundant. Second component is this endowment. We don't think that you can trust a company to run such a system because inevitably the company at some point will either get greedy and start to try and make money off the top of the money that has been put in the endowment or they'll just make a mistake and so if you run it as a foundation perhaps not company, but their foundation is run by humans and humans make mistakes. And so we looked at this and we said, well, what if we just, would you say, devolve that power to math and math alone and allow that to run the system? We think that's much, much more viable over, you know, centuries timeframes rather than, yeah, human run institutions. That makes sense. And permanent storage sort of as a concept makes sense. But then I think about the user in this and like, what about real time retrieval? Like for our generation, for accessing the things that are happening in real time, like how does it work? How does a normal person take advantage of the permaweb? Yes. So real time retrieval is done thanks to, well, I told you I was kind of a fan of BitTorrent back in the day. We basically took BitTorrent, modified it slightly to make it so that you're not just rewarded for giving bandwidth, but plausibly other things as well. And that system can adapt. It's kind of like an adaptation of the BitTorrent mechanism design. Yes, but that bandwidth swapping is essentially the base way that you get access to data in your network. On, but that bandwidth swapping is essentially the base way that you get access to data in your network. On top of that, we have a system whereby users can come to a gateway, we call it, and anyone can run one of these systems. And they expose the data in people's browsers. This is really exciting. Now you have this sort of what we call the permaweb, a web of knowledge that is interconnected and doesn't get forgotten. And anyone can go to a different gateway and get access to it in the browser, on their mobile, wherever it happens to be. So it's almost like a modification to the base protocols of the web, HTTP, allow it to have memory. So you don't really need like an archival service. It is an archival service in itself. And one way to think of it is if the web and the internet connected people over space, the idea of our web is to connect people over time as well as space. So you put a piece of information into it, and then it goes into this sort of permanent knowledge commons, if you will. And that is a very exciting thing for both of us, I think. Yes. And then once it's there, anyone can access it in the future. You can speak to people in the future and you can read what people thought in the past. It's the basic idea. So these discovery mechanisms, these are gateways that you enter through existing browser technology, essentially. Exactly. It plugs totally into the existing systems. We think that the web is basically made up of what we call the web. It's really just a stack of these technologies. Now we was just another layer on top of that very deep stack. So all we've known is actually speak to each other through HTTP, interestingly. And so you can point your browser and now we've known and say, hey, give me the price of storing this many bytes. It'll just return it and it'll render in the browser. It's all kind of intermingled with the web as it currently exists today. It's just adding long-term memory, essentially. Got it. So imagine I'm somebody who's not very technical. I actually don't imagine that. I'm not very technical. So if somebody is sharing content and it's licensed for reuse, and their idea is that like, oh, I'd like unedited people to discover this content, or people like her who are doing her kinds of work, like the mechanisms, content or people like her who are doing her kinds of work, like the mechanisms, like, is there something that makes sense to a regular person to enter where this lives? And how would I find what I'm looking for? Like, for instance, if I wanted to look for footage of war crimes that's been released under an open license, because people want to get the word out there, or I want to look at the archives of the Apple data or anything else that might have been stored in this way? Well, because it all intermingles with the webs that currently exist, we get this strange effect that Google actually indexes it. So you just search and you'll find the content from it. Yeah, that's very helpful. But one of the things I'm so excited about with the work that we've been doing together actually is this idea that, so data on the PromoWeb is on our weave, the sort of protocol underneath it is tagged. We saw that basically when you have a ledger, when you're trying to archive things, you want to not just store the data itself, but you want to store arbitrary tags that you can set as well as you know who is the person uploaded it when did they upload it these types of basic pieces of information and we realized by working with you guys that actually what we can do is we can make it so that the license data itself can be atomically associated so sort of combined into that what we call a transaction id so the identifier of the piece of information, such that when you transmit that piece of information, you are necessarily transmitting the license information too. And this is what's so exciting about the, well, should we jump into maybe the standard we built together? I was going to say, so yeah, this dovetails with the fact that ARWI recently introduced the support for CC licensing. And so, and the thing that we would really like to explore is like the impact that that might have on people who are archiving knowledge or are cultural heritage practitioners, digitizing collections within the open community. Like what does this mean for them? Yeah. So this means that basically when you publish a piece of information to the web, now, if you put it on the promo web, you can put the license data itself. You can set what CC license you want and so on into the upload. And then when someone uses that link, so maybe they embed your image on their website or something, other people can see, oh, right-click, view, open image in new tab, and then see that identifier, put it into a block explorer in Arweave. put it into a block explorer and are we? And they can see, oh, that's CC license, you know, so on. And which is really powerful because we hope that we can avoid with this system ending up in the trap of the current web, which is like everything is basically unlicensed by default. Nobody's really thinking it through. And we're, you know, there's 500 million pieces of data on this permanent web we built now, but it's still very early days. So our hope is that we can sort of encourage people to set the license type of the data as we go, and then it will become the standard behavior. So we don't end up with a web of unlicensed data. We end up with a web where almost everything is properly licensed, and you can kind of understand how you can reuse it and remix it in the future. So attribution and provenance are just baked into these pieces of data on the premise. That's exactly right. Yeah. Right. Well, I mean, it's interesting. And it's also interesting, particularly in light of sort of CC's strategic shift. Like it's not just sharing for sharing's sake. It's not that everything must be open, but we're very much focused on something that we call better sharing. And so there's a number of ways that one can talk about that, but like sharing to improve the world based on practices that empower and enable everyone. So not everything should be openly licensed, for instance. There are culturally sensitive materials that maybe shouldn't be. There are there is traditional knowledge that may be held that really shouldn't even be subject to copyright. But here we are in this world where that just happens automatically. we are in this world where that just happens automatically and so thinking about how are we would make sharing better sort of more broadly within the commons and sort of for the purpose of the public good well i mean what we're attempting to build is an open knowledge commons if you will like this we really want it to be such that if there's any human out there that thinks that a piece of information is useful and should be sort of available to other people in the future, and licensing is self-evidently part of that, you don't think this will be useful to people in the future without thinking, well, how should it be useful? You need to explain that as part of it. But we want to make it so that that ability, kind of superpower, if you will, of storing the information for essentially indefinite periods of time is available to all people for the lowest possible cost. And that's another interesting thing about the network. It doesn't try and extract value at all. It offers the service at the minimal cost that we think is essentially risk tolerance. We say 0.5% storage cost decline. You could imagine it other ways, but we think 0.5% is pretty conservative. Yes, and so the network doesn't try and extract value from people it tries to instead just make this utility available got it so it's a sort of a facilitation of an open knowledge commons is there are there no cases where you're seeing or is it even possible to privately store things on the firmware or is that just not is that part of the equation? You can store ciphertext if you want to. That's totally possible. There's no like, you know, would you say true private data? It's all on a public ledger, but if it's sufficiently encrypted ciphertext, there's an expectation in society that that is a, that is secure. And frankly, it's actually a very interesting question, right? Do you think that all encryption algorithms, or we will ever get encryption algorithms which will never be broken? There's a school of thought that says yes, and we're already there. There's a school of thought that says probably not. I think I'm on the 60% probably not camp. But yeah, I think I'm also in a minority. Interesting. So this system is built for openness. Yes. Like at its core. point yes so this is going to be a fun one for you because i frequently hear about our weave and file coin being described as the same thing i know and you chuckle i'm aware of the fact that they're different but can you talk us through key differences like why those differences matter and what problem one is solving versus the other and so on? Yeah, sure. I mean, it's two fundamental things. Our week is about permanent storage and temporary storage. So we see that there is this new ability that you can achieve with a decentralized system that where, you know, you don't have to trust the person that's running the endowment and you don't have the centralized control of the archive. I think you can use that to essentially enable permanent storage in a way that wasn't possible before. I think Filecoin's focus is more being a cheaper version of S3 because they see the arguments very different. They're basically saying, okay, well, there's all of this open hard drive space in the world. Maybe we could make use of it and offer cheaper storage in a decentralized way. That's interesting. It's just a very different model than Arweave. in the world, maybe we could make use of it and offer cheaper storage in a decentralized way. That's interesting. It's just a very different model than Arweave. The other component I would say is that data on Filecoin is totally private by default. So it's all encrypted. On Arweave, it's the exact opposite. They basically started with Bitcoin and said, what are the minimum viable changes to Bitcoin that have to be made, which is completely open ledger, in order to make it so that you can do this long-term data storage. And that's how we end up with a design where everything is open by default. That is an excellent explanation of the differences there. Are there other organizations or technologies in this sort of general storage space that you find interesting or are doing interesting things? Yeah, certainly that are doing interesting things. I mean, I'm kind of curious about the temporary storage systems. So there's also storage and SIA in that area. And I would say, I mean, I'm not sure if you can call $15 or something an investment per se, but I was an early contributor to storage, which was the first attempt, as far as I'm aware at least, to build a properly decentralized storage system, but it's focused on temporary storage. Yeah, I think that there is something interesting happening there. My personal view of blockchains is that they're like large, slow databases that are kind of expensive. So you have to have a really good reason to use one. And we see that it's, well, you use it for the things that are not possible in the centralized space. So you can't trust a company to do this. So trusting math is much better. And not having a single centralized point of failure is a really important thing for a system like this, like a 10x improvement over the old archiving systems. So that's where we saw that there was this niche to use this blockchain technology. But in temporary storage, I think it remains to be seen whether that idea that you can make use of all of this spare hard drive space in the world, it remains to be seen if that is actually possible long-term. But it would be cool if it was for sure. Yes. So you're sort of weaving into this, but let's just talk about decentralization as a concept. So why you think it's necessary, why you think it's important. And also like, is there a world where it's balanced with centralization as well? Like that there are offsetting technologies or use cases? Yeah, that's very interesting. So I think maybe this is, I've already kind of given this away, but I don't see decentralization as an end in itself. It's just a means. And it's a means for which we pay a high cost too. Like it's not a cheap thing because you have to have basic what decentralization essentially means is literally non centralization. So replication redundancy is a necessary part of that. Else when something stops working, when the central thing stops working, the whole thing stops working. And so you pay a real cost for doing this. I don't think that it's a sensible solution to every problem in any sense. But for extremely long-term archival data storage, I think it's actually a perfect fit, if you will. Same with running an endowment structure that you can't trust any humans to touch. I think Bitcoin is also like this. Bitcoin says, I wish that Bitcoin wasn't just burning energy with its work, but that's a separate conversation. Oh, yes. Right. But, you know, the idea that you can have a trustless mint in Bitcoin, that's really powerful and it requires decentralization. Basically, anywhere you have the ability for someone to print money, unfortunately, history shows they do and they do it en masse until it breaks. And so Bitcoin is a cool solution to that problem that requires decentralization. I wouldn't insert it where it's not necessary. And you could even argue, and you were saying, is there some mix between the two? Well, I think, you know, systems like Arweave and Bitcoin are actually sort of like that. So Bitcoin, for example, is controlled by, there was an interesting DARPA study that was published yesterday, I think, about potential vulnerabilities of blockchains. And they argued, well, decentralized kind of, but you only need to coerce four people in order to change the way that the big protocol processes new transactions. So decentralized, right? But that's also not the important thing. Because as I see it, it doesn't really matter what those four people are doing. I mean, as long as they continue to process transactions, and this is a technical conversation that's interesting, but maybe we shouldn't get into it now. But putting that aside, the important thing is no matter how much hashing power they have, they can't print more than 21 million tokens. And in the case of Arweave, they can't rewind time and remove data or alter data or anything like that. So math enforces this stuff. And then we have decentralization or close to decentralization to make sure that we don't have this single centralized point of failure problem. So I think that actually everything that we believe is or is claimed to be decentralized is quasi-decentralized. Yeah, relative to the dream of everybody's running this currency node on their phone and there's like millions of them or tens of millions of them. That's just not realistic. It's unfortunately not how the world works. But I also don't think it's necessary to get utility out of these systems. Right. Well, that's a very, it's a very practical way of looking at it. And I'm glad you brought up some of the things that we wish might be different because within our community and beyond the community, there are very mixed feelings and very varied levels of understanding about blockchain technology broadly. So I do appreciate you sort of speaking through it in sort of practical terms. I mean, we see folks who are huge advocates and then we have folks who really don't understand. And then we have others who just say it's one giant scam. Like there's no utility. There's, it's, what is, like there's no utility. There's it's what is it? It's the solution in search of a problem, I think is the phrase that folks like to toss around. And so I would be curious to hear your thoughts, because you are in this space, like on these existing narratives, like what's your advice for people who are apprehensive or who are overwhelmed, but who may actually be technologically curious? So I can say that I really empathize with all of those arguments, apart from the last one, maybe we'll get there in a second. But I would say that the important thing here is not to throw out the baby with the bathwater, right? Like, there is so much nonsense in the blockchain space, endless, and it keeps happening in these cycles. There's a cycle in 2011, then in 2015, then in 2017, then in 2021 of like hype and nonsense and noise. And I can understand why that would put people off. And it puts me off, frankly. I despise working around this stuff all day because I don't really care about the thing we're doing and I just don't really care about speculation, frankly. But here's my sort of, what I've come to understand of what's happening here. Basically, there is a core technology here that is useful. And I'll get to that in a second. But that technology itself is to some extent, at least, partially financial. And the thing is that new technologies, they always produce bubbles. Unfortunately, this is the going to kill the, I won't quote it because I'll get it wrong, but there's this well-known cycle basically, where you get a new technology, everybody gets overly excited about it in the short term, huge amounts of money flows into it. And then the bubble pops and everyone thinks the technology is dead. And then sure enough, five years later, actually that's the technology that everyone's using. It just happened a bit slower than they were expecting. But in the case of blockchains, I think because it is at its core a financial technology, this has just made the bubble cycle component of it go wild, which has been very unfortunate in some senses. And it's buried what I think is the real need here, which is, look, blockchains allow us to transact as people without the need to trust each other completely. And there are certain things, there are many things that really doesn't matter for, but there are certain things where it's unbelievably important. One, I would say, is a currency. You give anyone the control to mint the currency and they will just do it. They'll go wild. It's sad, but true. The US used to be attached to the gold standard, right? But then the president goes on TV one day and says, oh, we said that these things were redeemable, but it turns out we printed too many and we're doing a temporary pause. The redemption of these notes you have for the underlying assets. And what you know, that was 50 years ago. They never unpaused it. Now they've printed 33 times as many tokens. Yeah, the printing of money is pretty wild in modern society. But it's happened all through history. Basically, you can't get away from the fact that if you give someone the power to print money, they're just going to do it. And I would argue that the same is true in information. If you give people the power to censor and alter information, they will do it. And so those are two areas that I think there's a very strong argument to say, well, if we can delegate this to math, which doesn't change, then we can add something that is useful for society. And that is the baby that please don't throw it out like i understand the rest is a whole lot of noise i really empathize with that it's interesting to think about that you wouldn't require that trust because i think you're like what if it's an area where somebody places something on the permaweb but then alters it like someone alters it and puts a new version of it on there for instance so it's like two distinct pieces of data or like, how does that work? Like, are you able to connect? They wouldn't be. I mean, you could connect them. There is an interesting argument for sort of memetic tracing, if you will, where if someone modifies something on the permal web, they can say, this is a modification of this old piece of data or multiple old pieces of data. And this is just in that metadata I was describing, which can be very cool. But you know, if they modified a piece of data or multiple old pieces of data. And this is just in that metadata I was describing, which can be very cool. But if they modified a piece of data on the permal web and they uploaded it again, by default, it has no relation to the original piece of data. Got it. And so there is the risk that humans, because this is what humans do, will misuse this technology, I would assume. Well, I think that's true for essentially all technologies and certainly this one. The goal here is would assume. Well, I think that's true for essentially all technologies and certainly this one. The goal here is not that. Yeah, absolutely. And we've put in place systems that are, there is a top-down censorship in the network and that is something we worked very hard to bake in, if you will. But there are systems that essentially expose the storers of data to their local laws. So some of these other data storage systems that are decentralized, they have that data encrypted. And that there's kind of a problem in terms of responsibility there, because, well, if it's encrypted data, you don't know what you're storing, right? And it could be illegal where you are. Right. It could be illegal. Whereas in Avi's case, well, you can just say, I'm not going to store encrypted data. Like that's totally within your rights. No one is going to punish you or anything like that for doing that. And then the data that's plain text, you can just look inside it. So we built a system called Shepard, which is basically a sort of generalized architecture where you can plug in classifiers and look for content that you do or don't want to store. And this allows you to basically adjudicate whether this is something that is against your morals or against the laws of the country you live in, and then don't store it. And that sort of exposes the network to, you could say, the meta of the information governance of the world, essentially. So if I am a storer and something comes my way and I object to it on moral grounds, is that recorded somewhere? Does the community see that response? It's not recorded anywhere per se, but you can always ask someone what they're storing. So you can go in and say, hey, do you have this TX ID? Which is important because now there's a means of essentially legal recourse against the storers. So if you know that there's some piece of data that's illegal, you can go, who's storing this? Just poll the whole network. And then you can find out. And then they can be held accountable. And so now they're heavily incentivized, of course, beyond the morals of the requirement to do so, to make sure that they're not storing anything that is deemed unhealthy in their society, essentially. Got it. So there are these safeguards for morality or legality sort of relying on humans essentially to intervene in what is stored and where. And what we would hope is of course that people live in, you know, at least some good subsection of people live in democratic countries where there is a sane legal system for changing that idea of what is reasonable content or what's not. It's actually very much like web servers. So if you host a piece of content on a web server, you are legally responsible for that piece of content. Well, as I described before, our Weave nodes are web servers. And so all of those legal responsibilities and systems sort of percolate through to this new level, if that makes sense. Yes. No, that does actually make sense. That's a really interesting, that's a really interesting side of it. Okay. So you talked about Shepard a bit. Are there other new things that you're working on or within the Arweave ecosystem that are particularly interesting? Well, I mean, many. How much time do you have? Right. I don't know. We just got done with the Open Web Foundry demo day. So the Open Web Foundry is a series we run. It's kind of like a startup incubator for people building applications on top of the PermaWeb. And there are people building all sorts of exciting stuff there, channeling the system for storing sort of personal legacy items, but all the way through to really interesting stuff like storing, what do you say, academic accomplishment certificates, right? Because then you have this open ledger that anyone can access and anyone can contribute to. And it's kind of like you get the benefits of an open protocol versus this closed system where you have to sign up with this company who gets to decide who can certificate certain things and not. Yeah, and this is an open protocol. Anyone can come along and say, well, I certify you as an expert and such. And whether people choose to trust me or not is their business, but it's open. And that's a pretty interesting use of the technology. But there's frankly so many more things. It's hard to list off. Oh, that's neat. So this is an incubator specifically for the permaweb then? Exactly. Yeah. For building permaweb applications. So this was a little bit of a sideways discovery, you could say. But when we built the permanent web and we shipped it, we got thinking about, well, it serves all of this information and web pages. What happens if you put web apps inside it? And then we thought, oh, well, they're permanent. That's kind of cool. You pay once, you store the app forever. It never goes anywhere. And then we realized, oh, well, that means from the user's perspective that if there's a version of the application that they like, the developer can't take it away. This is not theoretical. This is really useful. Because in the Web2 world, the game is basically like offer a service for free for everyone. And then at some point, once you've captured the market, start essentially trying to extract as much value as possible as you can from the, exactly, the captive audience. Well, you can't do that with the Pumweb app. You get these sort of what you see is what you get forever guarantees, which is pretty cool. And then there's this other side of it, which is, huh. So one of the things that Pumweb does is it changes the, say, relationship of control between users or people and information. It's this neutral data lake where nobody can change a piece of information after it's been uploaded. And that allows you to build these web applications that have no centralized controller. It doesn't mean they're anarchistic, but it means that their content policies are baked in from the start. And so everybody can understand the deal they are making when they start to use an application and no centralized controller can come along and say, oh, actually, we've just decided to completely change that, which is a really powerful thing. We think it totally changes the power relationships on the web fundamentally. It does. It makes me think of a number of these technologies that have been free to start. And then all of a sudden it's like, oh, we did say this is going to be free forever, but actually if we're going to use more than this amount of space or if you're going to do this differently or now we're going to start collecting your data it also makes me think of the old arcade games that you can play on the internet archive which it's important that some of these things stay the way they were because we don't want to lose we don't want to lose that era the thing that it always comes to mind for me most is two examples the first is medium so if you know used medium back like five years ago as your blogging platform well you you signed up and they're like here's a free blog and but you thought that was kind of cool you shared that link with so many people and then one day they came along they said oh actually we're going to monetize your content and put it behind a paywall and you don't get to choose and now all of your readers have to pay us to access your content just totally crazy and same with like gmail when you start using gmail at the beginning you uh well if you're like me i obviously did not read the terms and conditions i was like yep sure let's do it but that was 14 years ago or something. And over that time, they completely changed the deal. So at the time, it was basically, here's email for free. And now it's, oh, here's email for free, but we're going to target ads based on the content, the messages you send and receive. And by the way, you might actually sell access to that data to, well, frankly, whoever wants to buy it. It's a totally different game. Yeah, these permweb applications basically subvert that or put a bulwark in place such that that can't really happen now the quality of the application must increase over time not decrease and otherwise users will just use non-version exactly that's a fascinating approach yeah there's so many examples of this recent i've read some article about vimeo changing their, what was it? It was like changing the pricing for bandwidth. So high volume, like people who had built up audiences were suddenly paying a lot more for those audiences to consume their content. That made some waves in the community. So before we wrap, I feel like we've covered a lot of ground, but sort of in the broader open movement where CC sits and here these open ecosystems on the web, like like are there any trends there that are particularly catching your eye anything that you wish would happen in this open ecosystem the trend i see is people hating blockchains and i'm just talking please try and look past the uh shouting about whatever the latest ape type NFT is or the latest coin that's totally going to pump. Forget it, that's annoying. And it's zero-sum games in a lot of ways. But I really see a lot of people that, if we could cut through that noise, a lot of people that would find real interest and value in the stuff that's being created, totally discarding it because of the things around it. And I find that so sad to watch and i've seen this cycle actually like three times in depth so far so the first time was like 2015 ish 2014 2015 bitcoin had an excitement bubble first one or the first main well it's a second major one technically but the one that like really people started to talk about, the first one was so niche no one even noticed, essentially. Yes, but there was this hype bubble and then you saw people like, ah, actually blockchains are terrible when the prices came down. And then 2017, 2018, blockchains are terrible. And it's like, okay, not really. It's just like all things in life, some good, some bad. And it requires a person to engage and to sort through it. But I promise I will give you some tiny number of tokens if you can really give me a good argument why the entire thing is completely useless. I promise you it's not completely useless. There is some gold somewhere buried in here. That sounds like a good challenge to our listeners looking for that. that utility well this has been fascinating thank you for delving so deep into some of these concepts that I know are sort of complicated and foreign to many folks it's been a real delight thank you very much for the opportunity we're huge fans of the creative commons so this has been amazing we appreciate that thanks for listening to open minds from creative Commons.
