The podcast aims to provide users with a well-informed perspective on interesting aspects of the interviews from a particular country. For each episode, one of the project staff interviews an expert on that country site. Welcome to this episode of Contextualizing Feminist Voices. My name is Kristen McGuire. I'm talking today with Verena Klein, who will provide some insight on the German interviews. Verena, could you start by identifying one or two themes that come up in the interviews that users should pay close attention to? Themes that are particularly important in Germany's women's movement scholarship or activism. So one interesting theme that runs through the interviews is the increasing institutionalization of the women's movement in Germany. of the women's movement in Germany. And after the protests of 1968 and its associated feminist movement, one can learn from the interviews that since the 1980s, the women's movement has become increasingly differentiated. In other words, like various interest groups, such as immigrants, lesbians, and academics, each organize themselves into their own associations to advocate for their specific concerns. And although the interviewees do not explicitly articulate this, the interviews demonstrate the specific process of institutionalization of the women's movement in political associations and institutions, as well as its struggles or struggles connected with that. For example, the interview with Sigrid Metz-Göcke captures how the women's movement has influenced higher education in Germany, such as the establishments of women's research centers. Heidi Meinsol demonstrates how issues of the women's movement found their way into the newly formed Green Party. And the archives also have one interview that offers an excellent discussion of the tradition of Black women's activism in Germany. Katharina Ogunteje initiated the non-profit intercultural association, JOLIBA, that mostly works with African and German-African families, which provides an example how organizations were formed by Black activists and intellectuals. The intersection between the women and lesbian movement is represented in the interviews centered around the Women's Center BeGINNE in Berlin. Moreover, those interviews are a powerful demonstration of how activism may be performed on a day-to-day basis by a variety of ways, including through the creation of art and dance. And in addition, the interviews demonstrate the wide range of innovations in the cultural spheres, like how women's theaters, groups, bands, and so on were founded during the women's movement. However, users might be surprised, but like from a historical perspective, the institutionalization of the women's movement came along with a decrease of demonstrative forms of activism, with the consequence that the attention and public interest the women's movement received declined more and more over time. That's great, thank you. I wonder if we could also talk for a minute about some topics that would be illuminating about the women's movement in a particular setting that aren't covered in these interviews. Are there topics that you'd like to point out for users to notice that are actually missing from the German collection? The interviews focus mostly on the women's movement in West Germany. So one topic that comes up only in passing is the history of the women's movement in the GDR. In the GDR, policies on women's issues were dominated by the agenda of the SED, the state party of the GDR. But from the 1980s onwards, various women's opposition groups were formed, which were interestingly mainly organized under the umbrella of the church. So that is one issue I would say is a kind of missing in the archives. Another issue is that in Germany, like most people, still associate the women's movement with the name Alice Schwarzer. So Alice Schwarzer organized, for example, the Stern campaign, Wir haben abgetrieben. In English, we have had an abortion, in which hundreds of women admitted to having had an abortion. And this campaign was historically important for the rights to a legal abortion and an end of the criminalization of abortion in Germany. She also founded the first German language feminist magazine called Emma. But interestingly, although Alice Schwarzer might be Germany's best known feminist, she's not mentioned in one of the interviews. That's really helpful. Thank you very much.
